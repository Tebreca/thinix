  - Ideally want a custom NixPkgs for each arch -> Big gaming gentoo style
    - To linux from scratch one must first invent the universal serial bus
  - Custom kernel compilation
  - Programs both server and client side
  - Proper PXE script thing
  - Maybe mutiple sets of images in same tftp-root
